		<fieldset><legend><b>Step One: Register</b></legend>
		The first step is to make an account(In-game and web-account both) <a href="register.php" target="_blank">(Click here to register)</a>.<br />
		Enter your username, password and email address, make sure that you dont forget them! In "Choose your client" field, you sould probably set it to
		"Wrath of the Lich King and BC" if you dont know what that is.</fieldset>
		 
		<br /><fieldset><legend><b>Step Two: Downloading WoW</b></legend>
		(SKIP TO STEP 3 IF YOU HAVE ALREADY DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED WoW)<br />
		<b>Download -&gt; <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/download/clients/pc/InstallWoW.exe">World of Warcraft Downloader</a></b>
		<br />This file is an external downloader(software which downloads WoW for you and continues when paused or interrupted).
		If you want to download and install just open the executable file and select "Wrath of the Lich King"
		
		When downloaded it'll either install automatically or you'll have to manually open the executable file to start installation.<br />
		This download process might take long because WoW installation files are very large, you can buy the DVDs if you dont like to wait.</fieldset>
	
		<br /><fieldset><legend><b>Step Three: Locate your WoW Folder</b></legend>
	
		<b>Windows Vista/7:</b> Right click your WoW Shortcut Icon if there is, and click on "Open file location".<br />
		<b>Windows XP:</b> Manually locate your WoW Folder, through "Search" or how you usually locate a program's folder(Usually the WoW folder is located in "C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft".</fieldset>
		 
		<br /><fieldset><legend><b>Step Four: Changing Realmlist(Host)</b></legend>
		Once inside your WoW folder, look for another folder called: "data", double-click on it.<br />
		Once inside your "data" Folder, there will be a folder either named "enUS", "enGB", "frFR", "esES" or something like that, double click that folder
		there will be a file named "realmlist.wtf" or just "realmlist", right click it click on "Open" or "Open with", if it asks which program choose notepad
		or wordpad and empty the whole file, replace the whole file with:<br />
		<code>set realmlist <?php print $LOGON_REALMLIST; ?></code><br />
		Save the file, and then close it!
		</fieldset>
	
		<br /><fieldset><legend><b>Step Five: Delete your cache(If there are any)</b></legend>
		Now go back the your WoW folder that you located in Step 3 and if you find a folder named "Cache" delete it, it doesnt corrupt WoW so dont worry!</fieldset>
	
		<br /><fieldset><legend><b>Step Six: Playing WoW</b></legend>
		Now everything is done, start your WoW either by double clicking on the Shortcut icon on the desktop or open "WoW.exe" or "Launcher.exe" from the WoW Folder.<br />
		When WoW starts, login with the details you registered with and DONT FORGET TO HAVE FUN!!!</fieldset>
